The Astro program is a planet simulation. However, it is not an ordinary planet simulator because it is based on real astronomical values such as real distances of planets from each other, masses of planets or even force of gravity. All these values have been appropriately multiplied by constant values so that the simulation reflects the real movement of the planets in orbit, but at an accelerated rate. The program was built in Python, mostly using the Pygame module.
