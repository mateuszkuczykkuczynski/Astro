Astro: Journey Through the Cosmos

Step into Astro: more than just a planet simulatorâ€”it's a celestial experience grounded in reality. Harnessing true astronomical data, Astro paints a vivid picture of planets in their orbital ballet, showcasing their genuine distances, masses, and the forces of gravity they exert. While the core mechanics mirror the universe, values are adeptly scaled for an accelerated celestial display. Developed in Python and majorly driven by the Pygame module, Astro invites you to a mesmerizing voyage in space.
